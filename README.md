Modern workflow in Data science - Assignment 1

1. Introduction
Coronavirus (Covid19) brings about a more severe crisis than almost any before. To protect people from the coronavirus, governments worldwide have had to implement safety measures that have a huge impact on personal and economic life. This report, however, does not aim at analyzing the consequences of Covid19, but to give an overview of the changes in the total of cases and infection rates over time (from January 2020 until June 2020). This report will zoom in the situation in some selected countries where coronavirus is more prevalent. 

2. Data
The dataset is taken from John Hopkins University (the JHU CSSE COVID-19 Dataset) which monitors the coronavirus epidemie situation all over the world and collects data on daily basis. The main data for analysis is the "Time_series_covid19_confirmed_global" showing the total of confirmed infected cases per country from 22 Jan 2020 until now. This dataset is then merged with the “UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table” to add some additional country characteristics variables (e.g. population, longitude, lattitude, country code, states...)
